Every data scientist must know about numpy, as many other packages are built over it. Like pandas, scikit-learn etc.\n\n### At the core, numpy provides the excellent ndarray objects, short for n-dimensional arrays. 'ndarray' object also known as 'numpy array' can store multiple items of same data type. Hence, helping in lot of mathematical operations and data calculations.\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"#### Create Numpy Array\n\n#### A numpy array is a grid of values, with same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. The number of dimensions is the *rank* of the array; the *shape* of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension. Array can handle vectorised operations while python list cannot, thus doing operations much faster"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nlist1 = [1,2,3,4]\narr = np.array(list1)\n\nprint(type(arr))\nprint(arr)\nprint(arr.shape)"}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
